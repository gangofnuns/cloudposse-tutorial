This repo is a shell for building a well-structure multi-account repository
using a vendor file.  To learn more about vendor software, particularly carvell-vendir, 
please see: https://github.com/vmware-tanzu/carvel-vendir/tree/develop

# Instructions

1.) Check out this repository. 
2.) Install vendir, using a tool such as 'brew'.
3.) Build the repo by running a command such as 'vendir sync' in 
the top level directory, in this repo.  The vendir software will then 
download all the repos specified in the vendir.yml file, and download
them, per instructions.
